====================================

Read more about this <a href="http://www.dotcastle.com/blog/font-awesome-icons-for-jquery-mobile" target="_blank">here</a>

Features:
---------
1. Based on latest jQuery Mobile and Font Awesome frameworks, updated when any of these frameworks update 
2. Icons based on SVG vector paths from the original Font Awesome kit 
3. PNG fallbacks for browsers without SVG support 
4. Four versions of the CSS files with two options for each format (SVG &amp; PNG) 
5. You can use inline version or url version of the resources based on your requirements 
6. Vector images are centered perfectly in their viewbox 
7. Icon class names are prefixed with "fa-", thus leaving the original jQuery mobile icons intact. So if you want to use "sign-out" icon from the font awesome kit, you need to apply the style as "ui-icon-fa-sign-out" 
8. Demo html file showcasing the icons with and without SVG support alongside the built-in icons
